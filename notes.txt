CSS

inline ineternal external
Selectors : tag name

decendent selectors: 
tag1 tag2 {
    here everything under tag1  is selected
}

select tag with id 
id names should always be unique
<p id="name">

#name {
    lines...
}

to use the same style multiple time's you use class
<p class="clas-Name">

.class-Name {
    lines...
}

for color notation 

rgb(x,x,x)
for transparency 
rgba(x,x,x,x)

hex notation for color #00aass
if the numbers are identical only one is enough i.e #00aaff === #0af

pseudo class
li:: last-child {
    lines...
}

selector priority 
!important >  Inline > ID > class or pseudo > element (p, div, ...)

box model:
height and width is for content
a layer above content is padding
a layer above padding is margin

margin > padding > height and width

margins overlap

inline occupies only what is needed
block level occupies all the spacce available 

position absolutew will get the content overlap and move around, It will stay
in the defined place no matter what

h3 + p {
    lines...
} here the p tag soon after h3 is selected, it's called the adjacent selector
